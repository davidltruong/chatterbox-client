## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. $ npm start
3. Navigate to chatterbox.html
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase the use of Object classing with HTML to create a chat message client. ChatterBox is a front end app enabling users to message either with the use of chatrooms. Messages are saved to a third party API that handles all traffic and saves all chat history.
